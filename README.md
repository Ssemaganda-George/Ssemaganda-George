# Welcome to my Simple Code_Store

👋 Hi, I'm Ssemaganda George!
A passionate Computer Science student and researcher at Makerere University, I’m driven to harness the power of technology for social impact. 
My GitHub is a showcase of projects focused on:

🌍 Social Impact & Sustainability: Leveraging AI for food security modeling, I’ve developed systems to aid local farmers in predicting crop yields and addressing climate challenges.
🤖 Machine Learning & AI: I enjoy building models that solve real-world problems, with a strong emphasis on making them accessible and actionable in underrepresented communities.
🌐 Community & Innovation: As Innovations Lead at Google Developer Groups, I collaborate on tech projects to empower youth through mentorship and skill development.



I’m always excited to collaborate on projects that bridge the gap between tech and human needs, especially in areas like climate action, digital inclusion, and capacity-building. Let’s connect and create solutions that drive positive, sustainable change!
